                <p>On most off-topic Miiverse clones, you're constantly being exposed to stupid memes, users you don't like, raids, and more. Miiverse World fixes those problems by replacing the old "one community that everyone posts in and 20 more that are rarely ever used" posting model with a simpler one: posts from people you follow are shown to you on a timeline basis.</p>
                <p class="note">&#9670; You can find (and be found by) all kinds of users through the smart recommendation feed, where you'll also see current trends and more.</p>

                        <p class="description">As the site's content is curated by the userbase, the only rules you have to follow are a select few to keep us out of trouble. Otherwise, do whatever you like! Make a Project M community, discuss world affairs, and post all the lolicon you want. If only I had free speech, or at the very least free will.</p>

                        <p class="description">Miiverse World is the first internet website <strong>ever</strong> to not be based on Cedar or Ciiverse. I built this shit with my BARE FUCKING HANDS. None of you stupid fucking Windows users know what it feels like to make a <em>real</em> Miiverse clone, and none of you ever will, because you continue to stay in your hole of downloading somebody else's PHP files and uploading them to 000webhost and calling it original. Fuck you. Suck my dick.</p>

                <p>We don't need any more of these stupid fucking Miiverse clones. Why do you keep making them? When will you move on with our life and do something that actually helps humanity?</p>
                <p class="note">&#9670; Sorry, it's too late to back out now. I may as well make this the best one so no Miiverse clones ever have to be made again.<br>&#9670; You say that every time. Just give up already.<br>&#9670; Shut up.<br>&#9670; No, you shut up.<br>&#9670; :(</p>
